# HealthPlus Analysis

**HealthPlus Analysis** is a modular Python-based data analysis tool designed to assist healthcare professionals in monitoring and interpreting patient lifestyle and clinical data. Built as part of the *Programming Concepts and Practice (PCP)* module at Level 7, this project focuses on structured software development, without the use of high-level libraries such as Pandas or NumPy.

## 📌 Project Overview

This system processes a large stroke-related clinical dataset and provides meaningful insights through a modular architecture. The primary aim is to support clinicians in identifying potential stroke risks based on patient attributes such as lifestyle, glucose level, sleep hours, heart condition, and more.

---

## 🧩 Modules

The project is divided into three core Python modules:

### 1. `dataset_module.py`
- Loads and parses the dataset using Python file objects.
- Returns data in a structured nested dictionary format.
- Restricts use of Pandas, NumPy, or other high-level libraries.

### 2. `query_module.py`
- Provides functions to:
  - Calculate averages, medians, and modal values.
  - Generate descriptive statistics for various health metrics.
  - Filter patients based on stroke outcomes, lifestyle, and conditions.
- Saves results to `.csv` files.

### 3. `ui_module.py`
- Offers an interactive CLI for users to:
  - Navigate queries.
  - View results in a user-friendly way.
  - Exit the tool gracefully.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook

A `main.ipynb` file integrates all three modules and serves as the entry point for executing the system. It acts as a demo-friendly interface for showcasing module interactions.
